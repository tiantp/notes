“**Exoskeleton for the mind**” usually means *a system that wraps around your cognition*—helping you remember, reason, notice bias, stay on-task, and make better decisions—without replacing your agency. Related work clusters pretty cleanly into a few research lineages:

## 1) Foundations: “mind extends into tools”

These are the intellectual roots for why an external system can count as cognitive augmentation (not just “using a gadget”):

* **Extended mind / extended cognition** (tools as part of cognition in practice). ([JSTOR][1])
* **Distributed cognition** (cognition spread across people + artifacts + procedures). ([MIT Press][2])

## 2) Metacognitive “guard rails” (especially for misinformation)

This is the most literal “exoskeleton for the mind” phrasing in HCI:

* **Metacognitive agent against misinformation**: *“Exoskeleton for the Mind: Exploring Strategies Against Misinformation with a Metacognitive Agent”* (AHs ’23). This frames augmentation as helping users *reflect on their own thinking* (confidence, checking, slowing down) rather than just feeding facts. ([ACM Digital Library][3])

(If you’re working on political-content labeling, this line is especially relevant: it’s basically “decision support + metacognition” for information integrity.)

## 3) “Memory prosthesis” and neural augmentation (invasive neurotech)

Here the “exoskeleton” is *inside* the loop—recording/decoding hippocampal activity and stimulating to support encoding:

* Human **hippocampal neural prosthesis / memory prosthesis** proof-of-concept work (Wake Forest/USC collaborations, MIMO modeling + stimulation). ([PMC][4])
* Continued work arguing feasibility for stimulation-based memory facilitation as a path toward implantable prosthetics. ([Frontiers][5])

## 4) Non-invasive neurostimulation / neurofeedback (cognitive rehab & enhancement)

Less “sci-fi,” more clinical/behavioral augmentation:

* Reviews and trials around **tDCS + cognitive training** improving aspects of working memory / executive function in some populations (effects vary; lots of protocol-dependence). ([PMC][6])
* **BCI + neurofeedback** directions surveyed for cognition (attention/memory rehabilitation contexts show up in reviews). ([PMC][7])

## 5) Wearable, AR, and “assistive memory” systems (non-invasive, practical)

This is the “external scaffold” path: sensors + retrieval + prompting.

* **AR / smart-glasses memory aids** aimed at dementia or daily recall (e.g., AR glasses + app approaches). ([Dementia Longitude Prize][8])
* Research prototypes and papers framing **LLM + AR** as real-time memory augmentation (e.g., “AR Secretary Agent”). ([alphaXiv][9])
* Newer academic HCI work explicitly calling GenAI a **“cognitive exoskeleton”** for externalizing/structuring/activating knowledge (e.g., “Brain Cache”). ([Generative AI and HCI][10])
* Example product-ish prototype: **MemPal** (wearable assistant to log actions + answer “where did I put X / did I do Y?”). ([prototypesforhumanity.com][11])
* Ongoing work like **NeuroTrace** (wearable memory augmentation system initiative). ([CSE at Michigan][12])

## 6) “Second brain” / knowledge-work exoskeletons (LLM copilots + personal knowledge)

Often not formalized as neuroscience, but directly aligned with the exoskeleton metaphor:

* Systems framing AI as augmenting creativity/problem-solving and scaling expertise. ([Vanderbilt University][13])
